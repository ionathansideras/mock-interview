## 🚀 React Coding Test: API Data Fetching and Event Handling

### 🎯 Objective

In this section of the interview, we will assess the applicant's coding skills and their experience with React. The focus will be on functional components, hooks, props, and event handling. Specifically, the test will cover:

-   **useEffect** and **useState** hooks for managing side effects and state.
-   Fetching data from an external API and rendering it on the screen.
-   Allowing the user to select a country and fetch university data from different countries.
-   Adding a filter to sort the fetched data in alphabetical order.
-   Tracking the number of times a user presses a key down.
-   Demonstrating the use of **component props** to pass data between components.

### 🌐 API Endpoint

The data for this task will be fetched from the following API endpoint:

```bash
http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country=country
```

You will need to modify the `country` parameter to fetch data from different countries based on user selection.

### ⚠️ Important Notes

-   **Code quality** is the priority. We will not focus on the page's style or design.
-   We are interested in seeing how the applicant approaches the task, their experience with React, event listeners, component props, and their ability to write clean, maintainable code.
-   The applicant's ability to think through the problem and implement it efficiently is more important than pixel-perfect design or styling.
-   If you use a custom hook, you will get extra points. We also check if you know about custom hooks.

Good luck! 🍀
